This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
read_csv("The first line of metadata
  The second line of metadata
  x,y,z
  1,2,3", skip = 2)

read_csv("# A comment I want to skip
  x,y,z
  1,2,3", comment = "#")
```
11.2.2 Exercises
What function would you use to read a file where fields were separated with
“|”?
read_delim()

Apart from file, skip, and comment, what other arguments do read_csv() and read_tsv() have in common?
na, col_names

What are the most important arguments to read_fwf()?
fwf_widths()

Sometimes strings in a CSV file contain commas. To prevent them from causing problems they need to be surrounded by a quoting character, like " or '. By convention, read_csv() assumes that the quoting character will be ", and if you want to change it you’ll need to use read_delim() instead. What arguments do you need to specify to read the following text into a data frame?

"x,y\n1,'a,b'"


```{r}
read_delim(file = "x,y\n1,'a,b'",  delim= ',', quote= '\'')
?read_delim
```

Identify what is wrong with each of the following inline CSV files. What happens when you run the code?

```{r}
read_csv("a,b\n1,2,3\n4,5,6")
#wrong number ofcolumns in the first row
read_csv("a,b,c\n1,2\n1,2,3,4")
#again, unequal number of columns
read_csv("a,b\n\"1")
#incompleted quotes
read_csv("a,b\n1,2\na,b", na ="na")
read_csv2("a;b\n1;3")
#use csv2 forsemincons


```
11.3.5 Exercises
What are the most important arguments to locale()?
language, decimal_mark, group_mark

What happens if you try and set decimal_mark and grouping_mark to the same character? 
Error
What happens to the default value of grouping_mark when you set decimal_mark to “,”? 
It becomes the period
What happens to the default value of decimal_mark when you set the grouping_mark to “.”?
It becomes the comma

```{r}
parse_number("100.000,23", locale = locale(grouping_mark = "."))



```


I didn’t discuss the date_format and time_format options to locale(). What do they do? Construct an example that shows when they might be useful.

```{r}
parse_date("2010-10-01", locale = locale(date_format = %AD))

```


If you live outside the US, create a new locale object that encapsulates the settings for the types of file you read most commonly.

What’s the difference between read_csv() and read_csv2()?
comma v semi-colon deliminated

What are the most common encodings used in Europe? What are the most common encodings used in Asia? Do some googling to find out.

In 2001, the most used encodings in Europe were: 1st (56%): ASCII. 2nd (23%): Western Europe encodings (ISO 8859-1, ISO 8859-15 and cp1252) 
Asia: UTF-8, GB2312, GBK

Generate the correct format string to parse each of the following dates and times:

```{r}
d1 <- parse_date("January 1, 2010", format = "%B %d, %Y" )
d1
d2 <- parse_date("2015-Mar-07", format = "%Y-%b-%d")
d2
d3 <- parse_date("06-Jun-2017", format = "%d-%b-%Y")
d3
d4 <- parse_date(c("August 19 (2015)", "July 1 (2015)"), format = "%B %d (%Y)")
d4
d5 <- parse_date("12/30/14", "%m/%d/%y")
d5 # Dec 30, 2014
t1 <- parse_time("1705", format= "%H%M")
t1
t2 <- parse_time("11:15:10 PM", format = "%I:%M:%s %p"
t2
```
